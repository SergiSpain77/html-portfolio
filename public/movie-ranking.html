<p>This bittersweet love story is a masterpiece of storytelling, and it's impossible not to feel alive while watching it.</p>

<h3>The Lighthouse (2019)</h3>

<p>A powerplay of acting and directing. Things are not what they seem but everything's been there from the beginning. Best movie of the last 10 years.</p>

<h3>The Favourite (2018)</h3>
